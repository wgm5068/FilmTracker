# FilmTracker

This project was done to fulfill the requirements of IST 261 (Application Development Studio I). As per the course catalog, "A key objective of this design studio will be to introduce students to the challenges faced in different application design and development activities before exposing them to specific techniques to manage these challenges in upper-division courses." The gist of the class was that students were to use Java to design an application that focused on the end user experience. 


My love of films and coding inspired me to pick this topic for my application. In the past I have tried to track the films that I have watched via a spreadsheet but I found this very tiring and a lot of work to keep updated. So this is where I used the opportunity that IST 261 gave me to create a program that could help me and potentially others in tracking their progress. Obviously, there are similar applications and websites out there that do the same thing, but creating an application that I did all on my own makes it even better to use.
